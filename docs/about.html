<h1>Chamness sisters' "Kelda Lakelands"</h1>
<p> Since owning our own Kelda Lakelands some of our sucesses have included Best
  of Breed at the Paignton Championship show, Best in Terrier group several times
  at open shows with Kelda Henry of the Tors. Best in show at a large open show
  with Kelda Lord of the Lakes, and a first at Crufts. This dog also helped Martha's
  3 year old daughter Asenath to do well in junior handler competitions at exemption
  shows. He also gave their cousin a good start in junior handling
  becoming in 1996 the winner of the Terrier group junior handler semi-finals
  at Richmond. Their cousin also qualified to represent the South and South West at
  the KCJO competition at Crufts 1998 with another bitch owned by a friend whose
  dam was a Kelda. Sucesses such as this prove the wonderful temperament of "Kelda" dogs even with very young handlers.</p>
<p>Our home bred young dog Formidable Fred (out of two "Kelda" Lakelands) is already
  distinguishing himself by winning seconds, in good company, at 6 1/2 months in
  minor puppy and puppy dog at the Lakeland Club Championship show in November
  97 under Albert Langley beating two of the top Kennels' puppies. Also at the
  Plymouth and District Canine Association open show at just 7 months he first
  won his junior class culminating in winning Best Puppy in Group and Best Terrier
  in Group under the experienced terrier judge - Mr Ray Blackmore. </p>

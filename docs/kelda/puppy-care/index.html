<p align="center">A NEW LAKELAND TERRIER PUPPY by Rachel L. D. H. Chamness</p>
<p>
  Hints on helping your new puppy to become a happy, contented, well adjusted
  member of your household. (The following remarks apply to any breed of dog)
</p>
<p>
  First of all don&#8217;t get your puppy until you have time for it, especially
  at first. Train him correctly at the start and you should have a long and
  happy life together.
</p>
<p>
  Read plenty of books, listen to old &#8220;doggie&#8221; people, go to a few
  breed shows, agility shows, and obedience shows. Try to think of the future,
  you won&#8217;t want to say a year later on, &#8220;I&#8217;ve made so many
  mistakes, when I eventually have another dog I&#8217;ll treat him
  differently.&#8221; Remember your Lakie should live the next fifteen or
  eighteen years. Let them be happy years. If your dog doesn&#8217;t behave
  properly, it&#8217;s not his fault.
</p>
<p>
  If you have problems don&#8217;t hesitate to call the breeder. Join one or two
  breed clubs, breed club secretaries can be quite a help; don&#8217;t let bad
  habits start, remember prevention is better than cure.
</p>
<p>
  1. Make your puppy feel at home. Get it a wire cage as a &#8220;home&#8221;;
  this should be (about tea chest size) 22ins wide, 24ins from front to back,
  and 22ins high. This will still fit it as an adult, it will seem rather large
  for an 8 week old puppy so get it a soft cat&#8217;s bed to go inside. Do not
  use this cage as a prison, most of the time the door can be left open but it
  is useful as a place of safety when maybe there are a lot of children around
  or you&#8217;re busy cooking and may trip and spill something on the pup.
  Remember your pup is a baby and not a toy, respect his rights and his need to
  rest and sleep, do not let the children fetch him out of his bed when he is
  tired. Consider which is the best place to put your cage --- not in a draught,
  not where he&#8217;ll be cooked in hot sunshine or where it&#8217;s too cold.
  Its best put a few inches off the floor to avoid floor draughts, (try sleeping
  on the floor your-self). A blanket can be draped over the cage to make it more
  private or keep it warmer. A banana box fits inside to stop draughts too.
  Instead of a wire cage a wooden box of a similar size can be used, show people
  often use a wooden box as its more private and doesn&#8217;t worry the dog
  when there are other dogs passing close that they may feel to be threatening.
  The blanket over the cage comes to the same thing. The advantage of a cage is
  that it can be folded flat when not required.
</p>
<p>
  2. A cage or box is also useful in the car for the safety of all, get your dog
  used to going in a car, then you can take him with you on holiday etc. He can
  go in a hotel or someone&#8217;s home in his cage. The R.S.P.C.A. recommend a
  cage or harness for your pet while travelling, as very many pets run away and
  get lost when an accident happens.
</p>
<p>
  3. If your pup is a bit worried at first, when travelling, get another person
  to hold him on their knee for the first journey or two, then put him in his
  home and put your fingers into the cage to reassure him, usually they are O.K.
  without, but odd ones do need a bit of reassurance. Don&#8217;t let your pup
  start a barking habit in the car, we have travelled with many Lakelands of our
  own, and belonging to others, and never had a &#8220;barker&#8221;. If you do,
  try to ascertain the reason, try leaving the pup in its &#8220;home&#8221; in
  the car for a while when you aren&#8217;t going anywhere. I have never known a
  Lakeland &#8220;car sick&#8221;. Cages are also useful to keep your furniture
  safe if you are leaving your pup for an hour or two in a room where he could
  do damage, remember any breed of pup has teeth coming through that gives him
  the urge to chew. Give him a bone or something O.K. to chew while he&#8217;s
  in his cage.
</p>
<p>
  4. House training, here again your cage comes in useful, surround your cage
  (with its bed in,) with a &#8220;playpen&#8221; made from a large fire guard
  or other wire mesh - see through material, he can then see you, but he is
  contained to a small area. Cover the playpen floor with newspaper. Puppies
  usually keep their beds clean. They will use the newspaper to go to the toilet
  on. Remember puppies have to &#8220;go&#8221; quite often. Feed your pup at
  the same times each day leave water down all day, but remove food and water a
  couple of hours before you go to bed.
</p>
<p>
  Decide the place that you want the pup to use as a toilet. Quietly get up in
  the morning so that the pup doesn&#8217;t wake up, then put him in his
  &#8220;toilet area,&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  as he &#8220;obliges&#8221; say a word that you are going to use in the future
  to get him to &#8220;go&#8221;. Then give him lots of praise. When your pup
  isn&#8217;t wanting to sleep spend as much time as possible with your pup
  outside his playpen, don&#8217;t take your eyes off him for a minute. Fairly
  often or if the pup starts sniffing or running round in circles, quickly put
  him in the &#8220;toilet area&#8221; and say the word you are going to use to
  get him to &#8220;go&#8221;. Don&#8217;t forget the praise. When you
  can&#8217;t watch him put him back in the playpen with a toy or chew. Never
  leave him untended where he must not &#8220;go&#8221;. If you really
  concentrate on your pup, he will soon learn what you want him to do. Never
  scold, or smack your pup for doing it in the wrong place. It is totally your
  fault.
</p>
<p>
  5. Toys, don&#8217;t let your pup have articles of clothing or shoes to play
  with, he will not know the difference between old stuff and good clothes. Get
  him some things of his own from the pet shop, pig&#8217;s ears, cow&#8217;s
  hooves and marrow beef bones. These are his things to keep and chew when he
  likes. Get him other toys, such as squeaky toys; hard rubber balls or
  dumb-bells with bells in. Play with him with these. Don&#8217;t leave him with
  squeaky toys to destroy. Don&#8217;t let anyone get the pup hyped up with a
  squeaky toy, use it with care. It is a good idea to teach your pup to
  retrieve, do this properly, don&#8217;t start chasing him but make him come
  right back to you. If it&#8217;s a wet day or you are busy so don&#8217;t want
  to go a long walk, you can exercise him by playing &#8220;fetch&#8221; in the
  longest space in the house. About ten times is enough then let him rest.
</p>
<p>
  6. By law when a dog is out he must have a collar and lead with name tag. For
  training a &#8220;half-choke&#8221; is good, it has a strap that just meets
  round his neck, its attached to two little chains then onto the lead. This can
  then be easily slipped off for training exercises &#8220;off the lead&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  7. Training, start from day one. Think ahead to the things you will not want
  him to do when he is grown up. So don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s funny to
  encourage him to do anything you will later regret. If you may want to do
  Obedience or Agility, don&#8217;t train him to do something you later will
  wish to undo, for obedience the dog walks on your left side, for agility he
  must work from both sides. We breed Shetland ponies also spotted ponies, we
  halter train the foals and we find that if they aren&#8217;t led the very
  first time on both sides, it will take about ten more lessons to get them to
  walk properly on the second side. My daughter Getta rescued an eighteen month
  old collie Misty, that was going to be put down because she was destroying the
  house, her owner left her alone most of the time as she lived alone, worked in
  the day and went out in the evenings. Being left so much was sending the poor
  dog round the bend. One thing she had trained Misty was to walk nicely on her
  right side, this made it hard to get her to walk on the left. She was a smart
  dog and a year later she came second place in a class of three hundred at an
  agility show! Not long after she sadly died of cancer, maybe from the stress
  as a pup.
</p>
<p>a) Never give an order that you can&#8217;t enforce fairly quickly.</p>
<p>
  b) Use your tone of voice, firm and deep for, &#8220;No&#8221;; light and
  happy for praise.
</p>
<p>
  c) To have an obedient, happy dog he must like you, think you are reasonable.
  Reward him with lots of praise. Every time you give an order and he obeys,
  praise him, this is most important, don&#8217;t forget.
</p>
<p>
  d) Be consistent, don&#8217;t encourage him on the sofa one day because he is
  clean and dry, then scold or smack him the next day because he is wet and
  dirty. The pup will think you are mean and nasty, so why should he obey you!
</p>
<p>
  e) Decide what action you want him to take when someone knocks on the door. I
  think at the first sound he should bark, if he doesn&#8217;t, say in an
  excited voice, &#8220;what&#8217;s that&#8221;. Then pick up the pup telling
  him, lets see who it is, stroke him, calm him, go slowly to the door,
  don&#8217;t let him bark now; open the door, let him be greeted by the visitor
  from the safety of your arms so he isn&#8217;t intimidated. Go back inside;
  keep him calm, if he is too boisterous he may need to be put in his cage with
  the blanket over to calm down. If he is well behaved, when your visitor
  leaves, pick up the pup go quietly to the door, together, bid your visitor
  good-bye and return quietly to your room. If you don&#8217;t want him to bark
  at all, say if the baby is asleep, say &#8220;No&#8221; firmly, take him in
  the other room, put him in his cage, covered.
</p>
<p>
  f) Decide what you want but again you must be consistent. You can&#8217;t let
  him bark one day and not the next.
</p>
<p>
  g) Puppy parties; some vets run these once a week for 4 weeks or so after the
  pup has had its injections, these are very good and teach the pup to socialise
  and not get intimidated as they are all pups together.
</p>
<p>
  h) Training classes; find a good one where the dogs are well behaved and the
  owners keep their dogs under control. Some mild natured trainers let the
  owners get away with letting their dogs bark and be unruly, etc. This sort of
  class will make the pup worse, so find a good class, then do as you are told,
  and practice in between classes. The first once or twice at the class
  don&#8217;t join in; sit out and watch with the pup in the safety of your
  arms, don&#8217;t let him be frightened or bark. Go slowly.
</p>
<p>
  8. If you have children of your own or ones who visit, teach them to respect
  your pup, he has rights of his own, he is not a toy. He must be handled with
  care, not dropped. He must not be teased.
</p>
<p>
  9. Take him for walks on a lead. Don&#8217;t let him bite the lead, if he
  does, say &#8220;no&#8221; firmly, if he doesn&#8217;t listen, pick him up,
  tell him this is not the thing to do, put him down again, if he grabs the lead
  again, say &#8220;no&#8221; more firmly and if necessary give him a little
  shake. An extending lead can be used later for more exercise and freedom but
  with safety.
</p>
<p>
  10. Picking a dog up shows him that you are in control. It serves two
  purposes, one that he is in a position for you to protect him so he need not
  be scared and two that he is in a position where you are boss. When you are
  sitting down and it is quiet, you can hold the pup firmly upside down in your
  arms, this is a submissive position and reinforces the fact you are boss. Be
  sure you have a firm grip of both front and back ends as he could squirm and
  get a twisted gut.
</p>
<p>
  11. Getta&#8217;s 8 year old Gemma loves to sit upside down on your lap with
  you gently stroking her tummy, after a while if you quit she gives you a
  gentle pat on the nose with her front paw! This is to say don&#8217;t go to
  sleep!
</p>
<p>
  12. Rewards. Most of the time your praise, approval and love are enough
  reward. If you are holding a treat (a reward), at the same time as giving an
  order, for instance, &#8220;sit&#8221;; then your pup may be concentrating too
  much on the treat to comprehend the instruction, so have the treat on
  something close so that you can reach it quickly. If you want to use a treat
  sometimes, use something that is small and special. Some things you can use
  are: - take a big piece of liver, boil it, cool, then cut it into pieces about
  half an inch square, these can be stored in small plastic bags in the deep
  freeze to bring out a couple or so at a time. When you use them they can be
  divided smaller. Some dogs like sausages fried and slice these small, use the
  same as liver. The best time to give treats is when you call a pup, teach him
  &#8220;come&#8221; by voice and/or whistle him. If you whistle it will carry
  further, so you can get him back from further away.
</p>
<p>
  13. Never give a dog any &#8220;people&#8217;s chocolate&#8221;, it can be
  deadly. It is best not to give &#8220;dog&#8217;s chocolate&#8221; or anything
  sweet at all, it is not good for them. They like liver best anyway.
</p>
<p>
  14. A young pup is quite soft and pliable, so it is quite easy to put it into
  a &#8220;sit&#8221; or &#8220;down&#8221;. Don&#8217;t teach him two things on
  the same day; teach one command for a few days, then when he has learnt that,
  you can teach the next command. It is easy to confuse him. After he has learnt
  the &#8220;sit&#8221; and &#8220;down&#8221;; teach the &#8220;stay&#8221;.
  Put the pup at your side with his collar and lead on, get him to
  &#8220;sit&#8221;, then, command &#8220;stay&#8221; with your hand in front of
  his face. When you have taught him to stay by your leg, you can say,
  &#8220;stay&#8221; then move away just a little for a second or so at first,
  then return. Gradually move further away as he learns what you mean. Slightly
  increase the length of time to &#8220;stay&#8221; too. Keep the lead on, then
  if he tries to move you have got him instantly under control, so he gets no
  chance to disobey.
</p>
<p>
  15. The &#8220;Recall&#8221;. With the lead on, sit your pup in front of you,
  command &#8220;sit&#8221;, then take a couple of steps backwards while calling
  the pup to you, (say the pups name and &#8220;come&#8221;), when he&#8217;s
  come &#8220;sit&#8221; him again. Over the next few days, gradually increase
  the distance you move backwards, extending the lead as necessary.
</p>
<p>
  16. If you have taught the pup well, so that he knows and obeys the different
  commands, &#8220;Sit&#8221;, &#8220;Down&#8221;, &#8220;Stay&#8221;, and
  &#8220;Come&#8221;, on the lead; you can now progress to the next stage of the
  same commands, off the lead in a small space, say a hall or garage. Use your
  treat again.
</p>
<p>
  17. If you have given your pup lots of attention and training, and given lots
  of praise for good behaviour, you should now have an obedient dog that you are
  proud of, as well as a happy dog.
</p>
<p>
  18. Agility is fun, a Lakeland is just the size for mini agility, his long
  legs help him to run fast and jump high giving him a chance to win, that is if
  you can keep up!
</p>
<p>
  19. When you are out walking and meet someone go up to them in a calm,
  confident manner, this will transmit to your pup that there is nothing to be
  afraid of, no need to have a frightened or defensive attitude.
</p>
<p>
  20. Dog &#8220;Good Citizen&#8221; awards, and &#8220;Obedience&#8221;
  competitions should now be within your grasp. Love your little Lakeland
  terrier, be the leader but not the bully. Here&#8217;s to a long and happy
  friendship.
</p>

  It is a good thing to join a Lakeland Terrier Club. There are 3 clubs and they
  all have 2 shows each a year. The Midland Lakeland Terrier Club holds its
  shows in the Midlands, near Birmingham. They are very friendly and helpful to
  beginners, their committee members give help after the show on the special
  points of trimming a Lakeland, advising new members how to proceed with their
  dog that they have brought along. They also produce a Year Book. Their
  secretary is Helen Ashe, 16 Ebrooks Road, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. B72

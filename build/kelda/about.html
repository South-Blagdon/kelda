                    Chamness sisters' "Kelda Lakelands"
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Since owning our own Kelda Lakelands some of our successes have included Best of Breed at the Paignton Championship show, Best in Terrier group several times at open shows with
                    Kelda Henry of the Tors. Best in show at a large open show with Kelda Lord of the Lakes, and a first at Crufts. This dog also helped Martha's 3 year old daughter Asenath to do
                    well in junior handler competitions at exemption shows. He also gave their cousin a good start in junior handling becoming in 1996 the winner of the Terrier group junior handler
                    semi-finals at Richmond. Their cousin also qualified to represent the South and South West at the KCJO competition at Crufts 1998 with another bitch owned by a friend whose dam
                    was a Kelda. Successes such as this prove the wonderful temperament of "Kelda" dogs even with very young handlers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our home bred young dog Formidable Fred (out of two "Kelda" Lakelands) is already distinguishing himself by winning seconds, in good company, at 6 1/2 months in minor puppy and
                    puppy dog at the Lakeland Club Championship show in November 97 under Albert Langley beating two of the top Kennels' puppies. Also at the Plymouth and District Canine Association
                    open show at just 7 months he first won his junior class culminating in winning Best Puppy in Group and Best Terrier in Group under the experienced terrier judge - Mr Ray
                    Blackmore.

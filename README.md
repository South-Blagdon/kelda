Lakeland Terriers web page.

The html files etc for the web page.

Using Spress for the Twig template engine to add the menu, header & footer etc for each page https://spress.yosymfony.com/docs/how-it-works/

Guess I could of just used make to cat all the files together but if you ever want to move to Symphony this will be a lot of the way there. :)

    out in September 1939 Miss
    Irene Morris owned Kildale Squiblet (&quot;Anna&quot;) bought as a pet two
    years earlier, and with no thought of showing or breeding Lakelands. The
    photograph on the left is of Kildale Squiblet Miss Irene Morris had taken
    in about 1937. But with the
    war a wave of fear swept over the country and many loved pets were destroyed
    or sold to people who might be better placed to keep and feed them. The big
    kennels, too, were offering first class stock for a few pounds in the weekly
    dog papers.</p>
  <p>Soon Miss Irene Morris realized that it could be devastating for a small
    breed like the Lakeland to lose so many good animals. She seized this
    opportunity
    to aquire top quality stock and decided to buy as many as she could afford.
    This gave Miss Morris a flying start to her breeding program as normally
    top breeders won't part with their best dogs. For most of the war years she
    was teaching in South Wales. In 1940 the Kennel Club granted Irene the affix
    of Kelda, and a few litters were bred. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The affix Kelda is named after Keldas hill in Cumbria, pictured
    below.</p>

<p>The dogs did very well on a diet of potato
  peelings collected daily from the village fish and chip shop, and boiled
  with nettle tops, root vegetables and bones and mixed with any stale bread
  or scraps
  which could be scrounged. Luckily there was also a fairly good supply of
  the extra stomachs of ruminants which the Welsh called manifolds and the Scots
  the bible because of its many leaves, enclosing the half digested grass.</p>
<p>There were no dog shows, of course, and that part of Wales is a hotbed of
  terrier fanciers, so there was often quite a gathering of people looking at
  the dogs, and handing on their expertise. The dog papers were pored over each
  week, and Noney Fleming and Lady Kitty Ritson kept the Lakeland Terrier notes
  going in DOG WORLD, while Catherine Fisher did the same in its contemporary
  Our Dogs.</p>
<p>When the war at last ended the Kelda dogs found themselves in the show ring.
  Ch Kelda Tavern Song born in March 1944, was the first to win her title.
  Later,
  among several others, one of her daughters, by Ch Whinlatter Kelda Bracken,
  was Ch Kelda Wings of Song. But in the week before Tavern Song won her first
  CC she made history - by winning BIS at the big all breed open show put on
  by Neath after the war, the first Lakeland to have such a win. Kelda Lakelands
  had arrived!</p>
<p>There was great interest in show stock when the war ended after six long
  years.
  The wise decision Miss Morris had made earlier to acquire and breed from the
  best, paid off, with the result that Kelda dogs and bitches were winning all
  over the country and then all over the world. There have been Kelda champions
  from Argentina to the United States, from Norway and Sweden to New Zealand
  and Australia, and the name is known and respected almost everywhere in
  Europe.
  Apart from the quality of the Kelda Lakelands, their superb temperament has
  endeared them to numerous owners who have again and again sought out a
  &quot;Kelda&quot; when
  their precious companion has passed on. Miss Morris has always held that
  temperament
  is of prime importance, at the same time as striving for the best in
  conformation
  and movement. The Kelda Lakelands are known to this day for their excellent
  temperaments and soundness. They have good coats and move freely, thanks to
  the emphasis on good shoulders, fronts and hindquarters. Above all, they have
  kept the lovely Lakeland head - not too long, with right, forward looking eyes
  and well set ears, whose tips just touch the cheeks.</p>
<p>As well as &quot;Kelda&quot; dogs being regarded as special, their owner was
  recognised too by being asked to judge twice at Crufts and becoming the
  President
  of The Lakeland Terrier Club, and then on to Patron a position she still
  holds.
  Latterly limitations of age (Miss Morris was 90 years in 1996) and transport
  difficulties
  had curtailed
  showing, and it seemed that the Kelda lines, with their direct link with the
  best in the past, might be forgotten. But a chance move to Devon, in 1986,
  she states, has saved them, and proved they are still worthy of a place at
  the top. </p>
<p>Two or three years after the move to Devon, two teenage sisters, Martha and
  Georgetta (Getta) Chamness, made Miss Morris's acquaintance, they helped her
  with her dogs, they were impressed by the Kelda Lakelands and fell in love
  with them. Getta then trained under the late Freddie Sills (an expert Lakeland
  breeder &quot;Lakelyn&quot;, professional handler and judge), this was a
  priviledge
  to learn the art of show handstripping and preparation under such an expert.
  Miss Morris gave Freddie his first CC win with a dog he was handling,
  he always
  remembered this so was willing to have Georgetta to stay with him and his wife
  Julie
  and teach her so that she could help Miss Morris with grooming and showing.
  Miss
  Morris
  was still looking to the future so let the girls acquire some of
  her best blood lines, also let them share in the Kelda affix, in the hope that
  Kelda Lakelands will prosper for a long time.</p>
<p>Miss Irene Morris will be 99 years old on 12th November 2005.</p>
<p>Since the above was written, Miss Morris sadly passed away.</p>
